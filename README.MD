Michael's personal website is built with Hugo. The website features a custom dark theme with responsive design, a fully customizable home page (in HTML), a simple social media contacts page, and a tag and series system for blogs.

Blog articles supports most common Markdown syntaxes with additional support for LaTeX rendering with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). Blog articles can be tagged with tags for easy indexing, and can also be placed into series where visitors can easily access groups of articles that are meant to be read together.
