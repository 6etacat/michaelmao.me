My name is Michael Mao. I am currently an algorithm engineer at [Shukun Technology](https://en.shukun.net/) developing AI algorithms and foundational models for medical imaging and other medical purposes. 

My research interest lies mainly in natural language processing, computer vision, multi-modal learning, and their medical applications. You can learn more about what motivates me in my [mission page](/mission).

In my free time, I enjoy photography, visiting museums, visiting places of man-made and natural beauty, and tinkering with 3D printing technologies. I am especially fascinated by landscape photography and street photography. You can check out some of my photography works in my [photography page](/photography).

Previously, I spent 2 years at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a software engineer in ODSP (OneDrive SharePoint).

I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science with honors from Brown University in 2021, focusing on AI and systems. During this period, I was an active member in Brown's data science community, organizing Brown's annual datathon and designing and hosting machine learning and data science workshops throughout the year. I was also the Head Teachin Assistant of the CSCI 1470/2470 Computational Linguistics class taught by late [Professor Eugene Charniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Charniak).
