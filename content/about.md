<!-- My name is Michael Mao. I also go by my Chinese name 毛逸聪, though I generally prefer my English name when not in China. 

I am currently a research engineer at [Shukun Technology](https://en.shukun.net/) working on medical AI and medical robotics. My research interest lies mainly in computer vision, multi-modal learning, deep reinforcement learning, robotics, and their medical applications. You can learn more about what motivates me in my [mission page](/mission).

In my free time, I enjoy photography, visiting museums, visiting places of man-made and natural beauty, and tinkering with 3D printing technologies. I am especially fascinated by landscape photography and street photography. You can check out some of my photography works in my [photography page](/photography).

Previously, I worked at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) on the ODSP (OneDrive SharePoint) team as a software engineer working on data syncing.

I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science with honors from Brown University in 2021. I was the Head Teachin Assistant for the late Professor Eugene Charniak's CSCI 1470/2470 Computational Linguistics class.
