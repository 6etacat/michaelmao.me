## TL;DR

I am motivated to introduce autonomous collaborative systems and robots to increase the efficiency and extend the capabilities of doctors and other healthcare professionals.

## Research Motivation

I have been fascinated by engineering and technology since a young age. My desire to design and build stuff led me to learn basic programming in primary school and eventually study computer science in college.

Finding both interesting, I've been torn between engineering and research while in college. I eventually decided to pursue a software engineering position after college, but I soon realized that I prefer the freedom of exploration of a research role compared to a restrictive corporate software engineering environment.

I am drawn by the prospect of having autonomous machines complete mundane tasks, thus freeing up humans to do work that has creative and emotional components. I believe that for better human-AI interactions, machines need to learn from multi-modal data as humans experience this world multi-modally. I believe that my previous research goal is close to being reality as OpenAI releases the multi-modal GPT-4. 

Currently my interest involves applying AI technologies to medical applications. Coming from a family of doctors, I witnessed first-hand how difficult and under-supplied healthcare is. I believe that AI technologies have come far enough to be able to help automate mundane tasks in many healthcare scenarios, freeing up healthcare professionals to attend to other tasks and treat more patients. We have already seen AI being widely used in the real world to post-process radiological images and diagnosing diseases from these processed data, and many are exploring applications of AI in EMR records. 

I believe the next step is for AI to get involved in the more physical aspects of healthcare. I believe that current AI technologies have the potential to enable current medical robots to be simpler to use (for example automatically moving lights and cameras for best angle of view, automatically applying hemostats to restrict bloodflow, etc.). Then, with the maturation of large multi-modal models and reinforcement learning, future medical robots may become expert assistants, autonomously executing tasks that require super-human precision while working in conjunction with human healthcare professionals.

From experience working in [Shukun Technology](https://en.shukun.net/), a Chinese medical AI startup, I believe that the key bottleneck for AIs in medical fields is the lack of usable data. This problem manifests from the privacy concerns of real medical data, the cost of employing medical experts to label data, and the large variation in data distribution between data collected from different devices. 

With medical robotics, it's even more difficult to collect usable real-world data to train medical robots. It isn't feasible or ethical for medical robots to train on real patients, while it's difficult to create a simulation environment that is real enough to overcome the sim2real gap. I believe that there is a lot of potential locked behind a more true-to-life medical simulations and effective methods in bridging the sim2real gap in medical robotics.
